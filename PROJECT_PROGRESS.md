# Project Progress - SAM_gbXML (2026-Q4)

## Branch

`sow/2026-Q4` - bootstrapped 2026-10-06 from `master` `4228e6ef`. Frozen Q3 record: `sow/2026-Q3` @ `41889902` (not modified).

## Last updated

2026-10-06 (Q4 operational cleanup).

## Current status

Q4 branch cut from `master` `4228e6ef`, which is the exact commit pinned in SAM_Deploy's frozen Q3 baseline (`v20261006.1`). Bootstrap added only internal docs (this file, `AGENTS.md`). No product source changed. No Q4 product work has started.

## Q4 priorities

Not yet set by the owner. Record them here at the first Q4 planning pass. Known carry-over work is listed below.

## Known carry-over work

- **SAM Grasshopper icon redesign - PR #10** (`feature/sam-gh-icon-redesign` @ `e4e968d8`, open, base `sow/2026-Q3`, not merged). Analysed 2026-10-06: the branch carries only its own 4 icon-only commits (`e7a9e5b`, `72404a0`, `e924f12`, `e4e968d`) on top of Q3 commit `26111c9b`. Those commits are not reachable from `sow/2026-Q4` (Q4 is built on the promoted `master` line), so a plain retarget would list 12 commits. Replaying exactly those commits onto `sow/2026-Q4` @ `ace07801` is conflict-free (verified commit-by-commit with `git merge-tree`; identical to the net-diff merge). Planned action: rebase-onto Q4 as a new branch + PR, then close this one; owner-approved controlled task, not yet executed.

## Repository-specific next steps

- Await Q4 planning. Open PRs for Q4 work against `sow/2026-Q4`.
- Follow the continuity convention in `AGENTS.md` for every PR and closeout.

## Decisions / assumptions

- Q4 base is `master` `4228e6ef`; the internal files were recovered from `sow/2026-Q3` into this branch only, never onto `master`.
- Q4 history intentionally does not contain the Q3 branch history (the maintained `master` is the promoted Q3 line, which is not a descendant of `sow/2026-Q3`); the frozen `sow/2026-Q3` branch is the permanent record.
- Historical Q2/Q3 content below is kept as evidence; its branch names, SHAs and next steps describe Q3 and are not current instructions.

## Validation

- Bootstrap verified 2026-10-06: `sow/2026-Q4` was created at exactly `4228e6ef` and the push was a normal (non-forced) branch creation.

## Issues / blockers

- None at bootstrap.

## Next step

- Owner to set Q4 priorities; then start the first Q4 task from this branch.

## Q4 operational cleanup (2026-10-06)

- Reviewed every active Q2/Q3 reference in this repository on `sow/2026-Q4` (workflow branch filters, dependency-branch resolution, `.gitmodules`/validation, docs). Historical Q2/Q3 mentions (feature documentation records, the frozen Q3 section below) are intentionally unchanged.
- Changed (`ace0780`): removed the dead `$candidates += 'sow/2026-Q2'` fallback from the dependency-branch resolution in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. No dependency repository has a `sow/2026-Q2` branch, so the entry never matched and resolution already fell through to the default branch; behaviour is unchanged (PR head ref, current sow ref, then the dependency's default branch) and no per-quarter edit is needed.
- Checked, no action: the `github.repository_owner == 'SAM-BIM'` build guard (intentional; its comment names HoareLea only to explain why the guard exists), CODEOWNERS (SAM-BIM owners), and workflow secrets (no HoareLea-named secret). The local `upstream` (HoareLea) remote is preserved.
- Carry-over: **SAM Grasshopper icon redesign - PR #10** (`feature/sam-gh-icon-redesign` @ `e4e968d8`, open, base `sow/2026-Q3`, not merged). Analysed 2026-10-06: the branch carries only its own 4 icon-only commits (`e7a9e5b`, `72404a0`, `e924f12`, `e4e968d`) on top of Q3 commit `26111c9b`. Those commits are not reachable from `sow/2026-Q4` (Q4 is built on the promoted `master` line), so a plain retarget would list 12 commits. Replaying exactly those commits onto `sow/2026-Q4` @ `ace07801` is conflict-free (verified commit-by-commit with `git merge-tree`; identical to the net-diff merge). Planned action: rebase-onto Q4 as a new branch + PR, then close this one; owner-approved controlled task, not yet executed.

# Historical record - 2026-Q3 (frozen)

Source: last revision of the file on `sow/2026-Q3`, commit `84432a1` (the file was removed from the Q3 tip by `4188990`; `sow/2026-Q3` tip is `41889902`). Preserved verbatim except that heading levels are shifted down one. Everything below describes Q3 and is not a current instruction.

## Project Progress

### Branch
`sow/2026-Q3`

### Last updated
2026-09-23 - stray legacy project folders removed (branch `build/remove-stray-legacy-gbxml-projects`); 2026-09-22 app.config cleanup merged

### Current status
Part of the repo-family .NET Framework `app.config` cleanup: base [SAM#126](https://github.com/SAM-BIM/SAM/pull/126) plus 17 sibling PRs, all merged into `sow/2026-Q3` on 2026-09-22 (SAM first), with their branches deleted.

### Completed
- [SAM_gbXML#7](https://github.com/SAM-BIM/SAM_gbXML/pull/7) merged as `33d55c7b`: removed dead .NET Framework `app.config` files.

### Decisions / assumptions
- Every project here targets `netstandard2.0` or `net8.0(-windows)` and is an `OutputType Library`. Library `.dll.config` files are never read at runtime (only the host `Rhino.exe`/`Revit.exe` config is), so the net472-era binding redirects, `<supportedRuntime>` and `loadFromRemoteSources` were inert. They only emitted stale `.dll.config` files into `build/` and `%APPDATA%\SAM`.
- No `ConfigurationManager`/`AppSettings` use in the repo; deleted files held binding/runtime config only.

### Files changed
- 2026-09-23: deleted the stray `SAM_gbXML/SAM.Analytical.gbXML/SAM.Analytical.gbXML/` and `SAM_gbXML/SAM.Geometry.gbXML/SAM.Geometry.gbXML/` folders (initial-import `v4.6.1` csproj copies, an empty `Class1.cs`, `AssemblyInfo.cs`; not in `SAM_gbXML.sln`, never built) and the matching dead `<Compile Remove>` items in `SAM.Analytical.gbXML.csproj` / `SAM.Geometry.gbXML.csproj`.
- `Grasshopper/SAM.Analytical.Grasshopper.gbXML/app.config` (deleted)

### Validation
- 2026-09-23: `dotnet build -t:Compile -c Release` of both parent projects after the removal: 0 errors.
- Before merge, full `BuildAlls_v4.bat` (Debug Restore;Clean;Rebuild of every repo, starting from an emptied `%APPDATA%\SAM`): exit 0, 0 errors. The redeployed `%APPDATA%\SAM` has no `SAM.*.dll.config`.
- CI on the PR: build + spdx pass.

### Issues / blockers
- None known.

### Next step
- None for this cleanup. Continue with the next planned task on `sow/2026-Q3`.
